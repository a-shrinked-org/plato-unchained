00:00 Welcome to this sample transcript with time format.
00:03 This uses minutes and seconds instead of milliseconds.
00:06 Each line starts with MM:SS timestamp.
00:09 The system will convert this to milliseconds automatically.
00:12 This format is more human-readable.
00:15 You can still process this without AssemblyAI.
00:18 Multiple formats are supported for flexibility.
00:21 Thank you for using Platogram.
